# Shell V2

---

## Overview

`hsh` is a UNIX command interpreter. It is a replica of the `sh` shell, built from scratch in C. This project was developed as part of the Holberton School Low Level Systems specialization and is the second, more advanced version of the [simple shell project](https://github.com/jicruz96/JISH_A-Custom-Shell-Terminal) completed in the Foundations year.

This project was written by J.I. Cruz and Gabriel Abdul-Raheem.
